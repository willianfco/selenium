A colaborative repository to study web automations with Selenium on Google Chrome.

# Starting with selenium

### First of all, the chromedriver.exe should be downloaded, extracted and placed in the same folder as your python.exe, here is a walkthrough:

1ยบ - Open chrome://settings/help and get the version of your Google Chrome, this will indicate the version of ChromeDriver we will download on the next step.

2ยบ - Open [this link](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) and download the ChromeDriver version most similar to your Google Chrome version. There is no 64bit version    for windows, but 32bit works just fine.

3ยบ - Extract the chromedriver.exe on your python folder. If you don't know where it is, open your python terminal, it will be written in the first line.

### Then we need to pip install -U selenium on your python terminal and you are ready to play!
